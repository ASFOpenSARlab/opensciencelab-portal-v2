# Portal CDK Docs

## Directory Structure

`portal-cdk` is organized based on functionality, as described below. (*click one for more info!*):

- [`lambda_main/`](./lambda_main/README.md) - The core lambda function. Holds all the API/UI logic for the portal itself, along with their tests.
- [`lambda_signup`](./lambda_signup/README.md) - A Cognito Pre-Signup Lambda hook, to verify the username only contains safe/whitelisted characters.
- [`portal_cdk`](./portal_cdk/README.md) - The CDK infrastructure for the portal.
- [`tests/`](./tests/README.md) - Contains tests for the CDK application itself. They validate the CloudFormation Template generated by CDK. (For the lambda_main's tests, see [`lambda_main/tests/`](./lambda_main/tests/README.md)!!)

## Testing

Our tests are all integrated with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). This includes helper-plugins like [pytest-cov](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) that adds coverage monitoring.

**To run tests**: just run `make test` in the root of this project.
