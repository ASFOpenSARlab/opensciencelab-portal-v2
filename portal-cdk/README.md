# Portal CDK Docs

## Testing

Our tests are all integrated with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). This includes helper-plugins like [pytest-cov](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) that adds coverage monitoring.

**To run tests**: just run `make test` in the root of this project.

### Test Directory Structure

`portal-cdk` has two "root" directories tests are stored in (*click one for more info!*):

- [`tests/`](./tests/README.md) - Contains tests for the CDK application itself. They validate the CloudFormation Template generated by CDK itself.
- [`lambda_main/tests/`](./lambda_main/tests/README.md) - Contains tests for the portal's core lambda function. This is where most of the tests are located, and run directly against the code itself.

## L3 Construct Notes

We could only go with the [Lambda and DynamoDB](https://constructs.dev/packages/@aws-solutions-constructs/aws-lambda-dynamodb/v/2.84.0?lang=python) construct. All L3 API Gateway Constructs are ONLY in V1 (Rest), not V2 (HTTP). The Gateway and everything touching it is an L2 construct.
